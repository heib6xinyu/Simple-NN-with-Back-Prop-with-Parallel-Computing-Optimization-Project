# Simple NN with Back Propagation and Parallel Computing Optimization
## Introduction
Welcome to our Neural Network Project, a basic platform designed to empower users in constructing and training neural networks with backpropagation. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and functionalities catering to a wide range of neural network applications.

Our program stands out for its flexibility in building neural networks. Users can easily construct networks with varying architectures and depths to suit their specific problem domains. The core of our project lies in its robust training capabilities. We support various training options, including stochastic, minibatch, and batch gradient descent, allowing users to choose the method that best fits their dataset size and computational constraints.

Diversity in loss functions is another hallmark of our platform. With options like L1_norm, L2_norm, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Softmax, users can tailor the learning process to their specific tasks, whether it be classification, regression, or other complex predictive modeling challenges.

Understanding the importance of data in machine learning, our project includes a robust data preprocessing module for two common classification datasets: iris.data and agaricus-lepiota.data. This module assists in transforming raw input data into a format compatible with neural networks using one-hot encoding. Additionally, our system robustly handles and rejects illegal data, ensuring data integrity and reliability in the training process.

In the realm of algorithm optimization, we have implemented commonly used techniques such as RMSprop, Nesterov Momentum, and Adam. These algorithms optimize the training process, ensuring faster convergence and improved performance of the neural networks.

Lastly, we have focused on optimizing neural network performance, including the use of OpenMP pragmas for parallel computing techniques.
